        <h4>Research Interests</h4>
        Our body is in constant interaction with the microbial communities inhabiting 
        not only our gastrointestinal tract but also our respiratory system, skin 
        and the reproductive tissues. These diverse microbial communities outnumber 
        our own cells by a 10 to 1 ratio and have been increasingly reported to 
        play important roles in human health and diseases. I am interested in studying 
        how our body and our immune system in particular respond to the environmental 
        factors in orchestration with the microbiome.  I am developing an analytics 
        platform that will allow us to study the communication between the human 
        body and its microbiomes across many different physiological samples.
