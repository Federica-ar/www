	The relationship between our health and our microbial inhabitants is poorly understood and likely to be vast in its implications.  I am interested in integrating different types of physiological data that have been collected in a continuous fashion, including data pertaining to the microbiome, immune system, and metabolome, to study the dynamics of this relationship.  My work concerns developing an analytics platform that would provide the infrastructure to rapidly identify novel biomarkers within the collected data.  We hope that these biomarkers could then be applied rapidly and translationally to improve the lives of patients suffering from chronic diseases.
