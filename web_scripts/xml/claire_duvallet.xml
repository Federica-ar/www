        <h4>Research Interests</h4>
Studying the relationships between the microbiome, health, and lifestyle provides incredible opportunities for translational medical discoveries and public health impacts. I'm excited by the possibility of using various physiological data to predict disease states, both on the individualized and broader community levels. In particular, I am involved in developing a personalized analytics platform that collects data from a patient's microbiome, immune system, and metabolome to identify biomarkers to improve the management and treatment of chronic disease. Additionally, I am interested in looking at biomarkers in sewage to predict and track disease outbreaks and extract information about a city's overall health.
