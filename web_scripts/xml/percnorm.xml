Percentile Normalization is a non-parametric method for removing batch effects from case-control studies. This method was developed for amplicon sequencing data (e.g. 16S sequencing), but can be extended to other types of 'omics data. In brief, feature values (e.g. Operational Taxonomic Units, Sequence Variants, etc.) are converted to percentiles of their control distribution, separately for each study. This procedure establishes the control samples as a null-distribution (i.e. a uniform distribution between zero and 100). If the case percentiles are significantly non-uniform, then they differ from the control samples. Upon transformation, features can be pooled together across studies with similar case-control definitions. Pooling percentile-normalized data provides greater statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes.<p/>
