        <h4>Research interests</h4>
I am interested in how microbes survive and thrive in diverse and dynamic
environments. This includes understanding how bacteria sense and respond to
environmental change, the metabolic machinery required for different feeding
strategies, and how microbes adapt and evolve various lifestyles.
	   <p/>
My research is aimed at understanding how bacteria feed on sugars found in
seaweeds in hopes of developing alternative and renewable sources of energy.
Marine macroalgae are not only vital players in coastal ecosystems and the
global carbon cycle, but also offer a promising potential as a feedstock for
biofuel production. If we can determine how bacteria digest various algal
polysaccharides in natural environments we might be able to harness their
enzymatic capabilities and engineer bacteria that efficiently convert seaweed
into bioethanol.
