        <h4>Research Interests</h4>
	I'm a physicist and systems biologist currently working on the characterization of phage/host regulatory interactions and amino-acid/nucleotide recognition codes. I'm also considering evolutionary scenarios for microbiome assembly and developing methods to make more selective metagenomics, in which all the sequencing effort could be directed to map the diversity of particular phage families.

	<h4>Past Life</h4>
	I received my Ph.D. in Physical Sciences for a multi-scale work within the subfield of Systems Biology concerning the network motifs, the basic building blocks of transcriptional networks in bacteria. My work, that was supervised by prof. Juan Poyatos and prof. Jesus Blazquez, combined experimental microbiology genetics (the redesign of small genetic circuits in vivo) with bioinformatics and mathematical modelling. My Ph. D. thesis (in Spanish) can be found <a href="http://eprints.ucm.es/10460/" target="_blank">here</a>.
	<p/>
	<h4>Science and Music</h4>
	Before becoming a scientist I was a professional musician and worked as a professor in several music conservatories. My scientific and musical projects, as well as my incursions into the intermediate field located between these disciplines can be found at my <a href="http://www.franciscocamas.com" target="_blank">personal web page</a>.
