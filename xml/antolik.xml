        <h4></h4>
        As Technical Assistant in the Alm lab, I help out with various
        aspects of lab members' projects. My main responsibilities include 16s
        library prep for Illumina sequencing and training for users on
        specialized equipment such as our Bioanalyzer and liquid handling robot.
        I also assist with purchasing, safety training, and general issues
        around the lab.
        <h4>Past Life</h4>
        My research interests in the area of molecular ecology and evolution
        have taken me far from my hometown in Texas. After completing a BS in
        biology at Eckerd College in sunny Florida, I moved to southern New
        Zealand where I received an MSc from the University of Otago.
